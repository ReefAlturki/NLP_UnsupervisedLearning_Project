# Natural Language Processing Project Proposal

## Backstory

## Question/need:

**What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**



**Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**



## Data Description:

**What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**


**What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?**


**If modeling, what will you predict as your target?**



## Tools:
**How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?**

The following libraries will be used in order to successfully complete the project.
* Numpy and pandas to perfom data manipulations.
* Matplotlib to plot visulalizations
* Sklearn to build various classification models.

**Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?**
