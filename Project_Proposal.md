## Backstory



## Question/need:

**What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**



**Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**



## Data Description:

**What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**
The data in this project will be acquired from Twitter users' tweets about their experience with ASOS. We are planning to use Twint which is an advanced Twitter scraping tool written in Python that allows for scraping Tweets from Twitter. we are planning to acquire 50000 tweets from the last two years with roughly 100 words each. 

**What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?**
An individual unit of analysis is a document (tweet) in the corpus. We are planning to work with the textual features of the tweet.



## Tools:
**How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?**
We are mainly going to work with Python text processing libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn in order to work with human language data. We also intend to use data acquisition called Twint for web scrapping. and after obtaining the data, it would be stored in SQL database. 
For visualizing the analysis results, we intend to use python's visualization libraries:  seaborn, Bokeh, and Plotly. and for the Production we are planning to use Streamlit to bulid a custom web app. 

**Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?**
